#  Do server side ipv6-prefix pool management. Should be added in
#  post-auth and accounting sections.
#
#  The module also requires the existence of the Pool-Name
#  attribute. That way the administrator can add the Pool-Name
#  attribute in the user profiles and use different pools for
#  different users. The Pool-Name attribute is a *check* item
#  not a reply item.
#
#  The Pool-Name should be set as a configuration parameter
#  for every module instance. Different modules instances
#  can use the same Pool-Name. Multiple Prefixes can be
#  

#
# Example:
# radiusd.conf: prefixpool students { [...] }
#		prefixpool teachers { [...] }
# users file  : DEFAULT Group == students, Pool-Name := "students"
#		DEFAULT Group == teachers, Pool-Name := "teachers"
#		DEFAULT	Group == other, Pool-Name := "DEFAULT"
